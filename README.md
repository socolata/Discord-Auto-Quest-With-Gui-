# Features

🚀 **Instant Video Quest Completion** – Automatically finishes video-based quests in seconds by sending calculated progress timestamps, bypassing the need to watch the content.

⚡ **One-Click "Complete All"** – A high-performance engine that scans and executes all your **Accepted** quests in parallel for maximum efficiency.

🛡️ **Safe Shutdown (Worker Tracking)** – Features a sophisticated "Active Worker" counter. When **Emergency Stop** is pressed, the script waits for current network tasks to sync before declaring a full stop, preventing background "ghost" processes and errors.

✅ **Intelligent Validation** – Checks Discord's internal Quest Store to ensure quests are enrolled. Provides real-time feedback and warnings if no active quests are detected.

🔘 **Smart UI Logic** – The execution button dynamically locks (turns grey) during processing to prevent duplicate requests and server-side conflicts, unlocking automatically upon completion.

🛑 **Emergency Stop (Kill Switch)** – A dedicated button to immediately halt all background loops and safely reset the UI state.

📊 **Live Progress Tracking** – Real-time status cards and a global percentage bar showing exactly how many quests are active, completed, and the total progress made.

↔️ **Resizable & Responsive GUI** – Fully customizable interface. Use the resize handle to expand the window; the console log automatically scales to fit the new height and width perfectly.

layout **Minimized Mode (Stealth)** – Collapse the GUI into a compact floating bar that displays live progress in the title, keeping your Discord workspace clean while running.

🖱️ **Draggable Interface** – Move the Quest Master window anywhere on your screen with a smooth, native-feeling drag handle.

📟 **Real-Time Console Logs** – Integrated terminal with color-coded feedback. Now includes a **Silent Error Filter** to keep logs clean and a **Clear Logs** button to tidy up the console history.

🛰️ **Rate-Limit Safeguard** – Built-in 429 (Rate Limit) detection that automatically pauses and retries, protecting your account from being flagged by Discord’s servers.
