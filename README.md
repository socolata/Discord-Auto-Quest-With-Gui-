# Features

 Instant Video Quest Completion – Automatically finishes video-based quests in seconds without having to watch them.

 One-Click "Complete All" – A powerful button that scans and executes all your Accepted quests simultaneously.

 Intelligent Validation – Prevents errors by checking if quests are accepted before running. Displays a warning if no active quests are detected.

 Platform Detection (Web vs. App) – Automatically detects if you are using Discord Web or the Desktop App to ensure compatibility.

 Game-Task Safeguard – Identifies quests that require game detection. If running on Web, it skips game tasks (which require the App) and provides a direct download link to the Discord App.

 Smart UI Logic – The execution button dynamically locks (turns grey) during the process to prevent duplicate requests and unlocks upon completion.

 Emergency Stop – A dedicated "Kill Switch" to immediately halt all background processes and reset the UI.

 Live Progress Tracking – Real-time progress bar and status cards showing exactly how many quests are active and completed.

 Minimized Mode (Stealth) – Collapse the GUI into a small floating icon to keep your Discord workspace clean while the script runs.

 Draggable & Resizable GUI – Fully customizable interface that you can move anywhere on your screen.

 Real-Time Console Logs – Integrated terminal with color-coded feedback for successful executions, warnings, and error handling.
